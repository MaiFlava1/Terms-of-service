# Terms-of-service

MaiFlava's contents are following under provisions. You are using MaiFlava's contents in consideration of your agreement to these terms.

## Temporary

No AI, reposting, or Profit.

If you wanna use contact me and ask for permission.

If the project has an individual license, the project follows their license.

## Derived Content
#### License Inheritance
Derived content is subject to the license of the original content from which it is derived.

#### Additional Licensing:
Derived content may include its own license, which applies alongside the original contentâ€™s license unless specific provisions conflict.

#### Provision-Level Conflict Resolution:
If a conflict arises between specific provisions of the original and derived content licenses, the provision from the original content takes precedence.
Non-conflicting provisions from both licenses remain valid and enforceable.

#### Recursive Derivation:
If the original content is itself derived from other content, this process repeats recursively until the chain of derivation ends.

#### Final Authority:
The final applicable terms are determined by the earliest (or root) original content in the derivation chain, with provision-level conflicts resolved as outlined above.
