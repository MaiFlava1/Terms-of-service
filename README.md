   By accessing, using, or distributing the author’s content, you agree to comply with these terms.

### **Temporary Restrictions**

- **No AI or Commercial Use:**\
  You are **prohibited** from using the author's content for:

  - Artificial Intelligence (AI) training or development purposes

  - Any activities intended for profit or commercial gain

- **Impersonation Prevention:**\
  You are strictly prohibited from impersonating the author, falsely claiming ownership of their content, or misleading others into believing you are the author. Any such actions may result in legal consequences.

- **Anti-Social Use Prevention:**\
  The author's content may not be used for purposes that promote hate, harassment, discrimination, violence, or any other anti-social behavior. Any use of the content for such purposes is strictly forbidden and may lead to legal action.

- **Permission Requests:**\
  If you wish to use the content in ways that fall outside these restrictions, please contact the author directly to request permission.

- **Individual Project Licenses:**\
  If a specific project includes its own license, that project will follow the terms of its individual license in addition to this TOS.

### **Derived Content**

1. **Separation of Licenses:**

   - When creating derived content, the original content's license still applies to any elements taken from it.
   - The author of the derived content holds the license for any new elements they introduce, such as style, colors, and unique modifications.

2. **Joint License Compliance:**

   - Any usage of derived content must comply with **both** the original content's license and the derived content's license.
   - Users must adhere to the restrictions and permissions outlined in both licenses.

3. **Conflict Resolution:**

   - If there is a conflict between the original and derived content licenses, both licenses remain valid but must be followed in their respective scopes.
   - Users seeking to use derived content must obtain necessary permissions from **both** rights holders if required.

4. **Example Scenarios:**

   - If you create fan art of a character, the character’s original rights holder maintains their license over the design and concept. Your unique artistic expression (style, color choices, etc.) falls under your own license. However, the resulting fan art is bound by both licenses.
   - If a derivative work is created from content that is itself derived, this principle applies recursively, requiring adherence to all preceding licenses in the derivation chain.
