# Terms-of-service



No AI, reposting, or Profit.

If you wanna use contact me and ask for permission.

If the project has an individual license, the project follows their license.

### Derived Content
- License Inheritance: Derived content is subject to the license of the original content from which it is derived.
- Additional Licensing: Derived content may also carry its own license, provided it does not conflict with the original content's license.
- Conflict Resolution: In cases of duplicate or conflicting licensing terms, the original content's license takes precedence.
- Recursive Derivation: If the original content is itself derived from other content, this process repeats recursively until the chain of derivation ends.
- Final Authority: The final applicable license is determined by the earliest (or root) original content in the derivation chain.
